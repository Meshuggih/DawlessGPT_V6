"""Synthesizer engine for DawlessGPTv6.

This module provides high‑level functions to render different instrument
types (pads, leads, basses, drums, fx) based on scheduled events.  It uses
primitive oscillators and filters from `dsp_core.py` and applies basic ADSR
envelopes.  The current implementation renders each note as a simple sine
wave at the appropriate frequency; more sophisticated models will be added
in future PRs.

TODOs:
    [X] Implement a simple sine‑based synthesiser as a placeholder.
    [ ] Implement BLEP oscillators (saw/square/tri) for cleaner waveforms.
    [ ] Add SVF ZDF filters with parameter smoothing.
    [ ] Support envelopes (ADSR) per note and per instrument type.
    [ ] Add polyphony limiting based on quality presets.
