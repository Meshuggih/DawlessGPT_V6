"""Sequencer for DawlessGPTv6.

This module schedules musical events (notes, drum hits, automation changes)
based on the completed plan.  It supports a simple timeline expressed in
beats; each bar contains 4 beats and each beat can be subdivided into 4
sixteenth notes.  For more advanced patterns (Euclidean rhythms, rotations,
parameter locks), future PRs should expand this sequencer.

TODOs:
    [ ] Implement Euclidean rhythm generation and p‑lock merging.
    [ ] Support humanisation (random timing/velocity variations).
    [ ] Combine automation events with note events in a unified schedule.

    Each event is represented as a dictionary with at least a `time`

    drum patterns into events; note events for melodic tracks should be
