"""Effects engine for DawlessGPTv6.

This module implements lightweight reverberation and delay effects with
bounded feedback, stereo ping‑pong behaviour, post‑reverb low‑pass
filtering and sidechain ducking.  Only a trivial mix routine is provided
currently to combine track buffers.  Future PRs should implement a
Schroeder/FDN light reverb, a proper delay line with low‑pass in the loop
and sidechain ducking controlled by the drop section.

TODOs:
    [ ] Implement Schroeder/FDN reverb with variable T60 and post‑LPF.
    [ ] Implement multi‑tap ping‑pong delay with bounded feedback and LPF.
    [ ] Add sidechain ducking for the drop section.
    [ ] Support send levels per track and per FX bus.
